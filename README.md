# Investigate-a-Dataset
This is the second project of the Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. In this project, I conducted my own data analysis on The Movie Database (TMDb) dataset. I investigated the dataset and brainstormed questions that could be answered from it, assessed and cleaned the data, performed EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis) with visualizations, and drew conclusions from it.

## Steps 
1. Ask questions about the datset
2. Wrangle Data - gather, assess, and clean the data
3. Perform Exploratory Data Analysis - extract relevant data and create visualizations to answer the questions
4. Draw Conclusions

## Tools Used
* Numpy
* Pandas
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
